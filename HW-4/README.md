# Alex Schuler Week 4 Assignment

## Musings on Class
  This week was difficult for me. Most of the language I was using wasn't working how I thought it would. I planned on importing several pre-made images into my piece; but none of my image load commands were doing what I wanted them to, so I made some crappy stand in art.

  I'm struggling with combining a layer-based creation background with all these dependent formulas. It all compounds on each other in a way my brain is having difficulty visualizing. I'm an imagery based learner and when I work on something, I have to be able to be able to visualize the project top-down.

## What We Accomplished

1. Learned new p5 language:
* Maps function
* Animating using the Draw Function
* More math dependent variable functions

## What I Don't Get Yet

1. Too many functions and dependents for me to comfortably work with. I'm becoming less and less enthralled with this type of work. Visual-based tools allow me to focus on my creativity and not be frustrated by cognitive barriers.
2. Differences between processing and p5, which language is compatible? A lot of my processing commands haven't been working well for me in p5.

### My Sketch
Homework was inspired by Dylan Belcourt's assignment, saw a way to take it just a bit further: https://marahute.github.io/191-work/HW-4
