# Alex Schuler Week 6 Assignment

## Musings on Class
Michael seems much more satisfied with the classes progress as a whole, and I can see a definite uptick in the quality of art being produced. I'll admit to being uninspired; but I've realized a greater appreciation for my classmates work.

## What We Accomplished

1. Learned new p5 language:
* Spent most of the week getting a ball to bounce off the canvas.
* Conditionals! (if, then statements)

## What I Don't Get Yet

1. Adding blend mode to my swatches
