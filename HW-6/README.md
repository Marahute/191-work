# Alex Schuler Week 5 Assignment

## Musings on Class
  This week I tried to be more humble and accepting of the fact that this is new material and might take awhile for me to get used to.

  Class time was well spent, however, I wish we had more time to work on our projects in class, it seems so much more practical using code than watching it.

## What We Accomplished

1. Learned new p5 language:
* Random functions
* Tried to use algorithms
* More math dependent variable functions

## What I Don't Get Yet

1. I would like to figure out how to make my background mapping function from the previous assignment work on this one. It might have something to do with my windowWidth and windowHeight canvas setup.
